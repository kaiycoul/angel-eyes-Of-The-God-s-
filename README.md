ANGEL, EYE OF THE GODS

 Wings of roiling golden flame surround a single, burning eye that is larger than a human head. Its gaze never settles on one object for long, and it seems to be drinking in every detail of its surroundings.

 The omniscience of the gods is a matter of some liturgical debate. Only a scant few gods-typically deities of knowledge and secrets-truly possess the power to know all things. Other divine beings must rely on their mortal followers to relay the secrets of the mortal world unto them through prayer and confession. When secondhand knowledge of the mortal world is insufficient or when gods engage in divine espionage, they create an angel with one function: to see all.

 DIVINE FORM. Eyes of the gods typically take the form of a blazing eye the size of a human child. Two radiant wings extend from behind its angelic form, though it need not beat them to fly. Despite awe-inspiring appearance, not all gods wish to make their holy observers so conspicuous. Gods of shadow and trickery often make their eyes burn with flames pale as the moon or black as the space between the stars.

 DUTIFUL SERVANT. Most eyes of the gods are little more than celestial automata, following their creator's commands-or the commands of their deity's high priest without question Obedient eyes tend to watch cities silently from within church spires or inspire crusading warriors from the back lines. However, some eyes of the gods take a more active role in creating history. Such eyes might goad a paladin into accepting a grand quest so it can tag along as a chronicler, or encourage a brash and unstable ruler into declaring a world-shaking war. Lawful deities tend to recall these unpredictable servants to unmake them for their disobedience, but more capricious gods relish such willfulness.

 IMMORTAL NATURE. The eye of the gods angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
